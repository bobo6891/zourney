# Zourney

So you are going to relocate to Berlin and start working at Zalando. But you don't know how things work in Berlin. How do you find a flat? What kind of paperwork do you need to get done? Where are the best places to party?

Don't worry, our little pre-boarding [quiz game](https://tlossen.github.io/zourney/) will teach you the basics.

This project started as a [Zalando Hackweek project](https://ideas.zalando.net/projects/a7ff770e-f054-4420-a38c-3508e128e1fb).
