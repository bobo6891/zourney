The term is generally used to refer to residential buildings that were built before the Second World War. They generally have high ceilings, wood flooring, often a small pantry or maid’s room, stucco ceilings, and single or double casement windows. The Altbau period ends around 1949, when construction styles shifted to double glazing and concrete walls and ceilings. Unlike the term Altbau, however, we have a very precise definition for what constitutes a Neubau: buildings that have recently been completed and are ready for their first occupancy.\nhttp://www.ideen2020.de/en/3886/"},{"category":"Accomodation","question":"Which area is famous for its baby boom and as therefore as \"Pregnant Hill\"?","answer_true":"Prenzlauer Berg","answer_2":"Tiergarten","answer_3":"Love district","answer_4":"That does not excist - Berlin is the city of singles","solution":"The urban district of Prenzlauer Berg belongs to Pankow and is located right next to Mitte and Friendrichshain.
