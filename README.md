We are **truly international**, right? How many of you have moved to Berlin (or any other office of ours) for a new role?

I know we are good with the support we provide before you join. Did you really understand what you are getting yourself into? Did you find it easy to navigate the zillion pages online about "where should I live in Berlin?" or "how do I register for my TAX ID?” or “what is truly important to understand about Zalando’s culture?”

We pride ourselves for being a truly international company and we have superb mechanisms in place for contract creation, VISA support, heck, even working with an external agency which is our candidates' "concierge service" (sometimes). But do our candidates really feel connected to Zalando before they step into our "Welcome Day"? Or do they wait for the job to start and then maybe realise it is not right for them...(and then that bad attrition comes and spoils it all :( )

Game meet Pre-Boarding! Have you ever seen a career page where you can navigate your way through "what can i expect from this country / city / company"?

I did not.

Do you want to play a game? Move up from level to level, have fun, learn, get your paperwork done, understand, become confident and more importantly EXCITED about starting your work at Zalando.

The idea of this project is to link to our gorgeous career page a game to support their pre-boarding.
